📡 IoT based Monitoring System Using ESP8266 and ThingSpeak

A cloud-connected environmental monitoring project built using DHT11, LDR sensor, and NodeMCU ESP8266.

🧠 Project Overview

This project measures temperature, humidity, and ambient light intensity using a DHT11 sensor and 4-pin LDR module, and uploads the readings to ThingSpeak every few seconds using an ESP8266 (NodeMCU).


The ESP8266 collects sensor readings, connects to WiFi, and publishes the values to the cloud continuously—enabling real-time graph visualization.

🔄 How the System Works

> DHT11 measures temperature (°C) and humidity (%).

> LDR module detects ambient light through its analog output (A0).

> NodeMCU ESP8266 reads both sensors.

> The ESP8266 connects to WiFi.

> Data is uploaded to ThingSpeak Channel Fields (Field1, Field2, Field3).

> ThingSpeak automatically creates live graphs, dashboards, and data logs.


🎯 Key Features

> Real-time temperature monitoring
> Real-time humidity tracking
> Light intensity monitoring with LDR
> Automatic cloud uploading to ThingSpeak
> IoT-ready architecture
> Beginner-friendly circuitry
> Low-power and reliable ESP8266 operation
> Visualization through customizable ThingSpeak graphs
